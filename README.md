Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Vision Transformer (ViT):

Diabetic Retinopathy Detection is an advanced deep learning approach that utilizes the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for the classification of retinal fundus images. The system is designed to identify and categorize diabetic retinopathy into different severity levels, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment.

Key Features:
ViT-based Image Classification: Utilizes the self-attention mechanism of the Vision Transformer for effective feature extraction and classification.
Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
Severity Level Prediction: Detects diabetic retinopathy and categorizes it into different stages, ranging from No DR to Proliferative DR.
Performance Optimization: Fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy and reduce computational complexity.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable performance.
Impact:
Enables automated early detection of diabetic retinopathy, reducing reliance on manual diagnosis.
Assists ophthalmologists by providing accurate severity classification, leading to timely intervention.
Helps in preventing vision loss by facilitating early-stage treatment planning.
This model enhances medical imaging analysis and contributes to the efficient screening of diabetic retinopathy using AI-driven methodologies.
